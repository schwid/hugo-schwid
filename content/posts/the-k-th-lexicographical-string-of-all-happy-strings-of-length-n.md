## Introduction

A happy string is a string that:

consists only of letters of the set ['a', 'b', 'c'].
s[i] != s[i + 1] for all values of i from 1 to s.length - 1 (string is 1-indexed).
For example, strings "abc", "ac", "b" and "abcbabcbcb" are all happy strings and strings "aa", "baa" and "ababbc" are not happy strings.

Given two integers n and k, consider a list of all happy strings of length n sorted in lexicographical order.

Return the kth string of this list or return an empty string if there are less than k happy strings of length n.


Example 1:
```
Input: n = 1, k = 3
Output: "c"
Explanation: The list ["a", "b", "c"] contains all happy strings of length 1. The third string is "c".
```

Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, k = 4
Output: ""
Explanation: There are only 3 happy strings of length 1.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: n = 3, k = 9
Output: "cab"
Explanation: There are 12 different happy string of length 3 ["aba", "abc", "aca", "acb", "bab", "bac", "bca", "bcb", "cab", "cac", "cba", "cbc"]. You will find the 9th string = "cab"
```

Example 4:
```
Input: n = 2, k = 7
Output: ""
```

Example 5:
```
Input: n = 10, k = 100
Output: "abacbabacb"
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= n <= 10
1 <= k <= 100
```

## Solution

Let's calculate all possible combinations in sorted order and take k-th one.

``` go
func getHappyString(n int, k int) string {

    m := 3 << (n-1)
    if k > m {
        return ""
    }

    list := HappyList(n)
    if len(list) >= k {
        return list[k-1]
    }

    return ""

}

func HappyList(n int) []string {
    if n == 0 {
        return []string{}
    }
    if n == 1 {
        return []string { "a", "b", "c" }
    }
    var out []string
    for _, one := range HappyList(1) {
        for _, s := range HappyList(n-1) {
            if s[0] != one[0] {
                out = append(out, one + s)
            }
        }
    }
    return out
}
```

## Preformance

```
Runtime: 696 ms, faster than 5.71% of Go online submissions for The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n.
Memory Usage: 6.8 MB, less than 100.00% of Go online submissions for The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n.
```

Performance of this solution is very low.
In this case let's generate only k-th element.

``` go
func getHappyString(n int, k int) string {

    var out []byte

    for i := n-1; i >= 0; i-- {
        a := 1 << i
        b := 2 << i
        c := 3 << i
        h := a >> 1
        if k <= a {
            out = append(out, 'a')
            k += h
        } else if k <= b {
            out = append(out, 'b')
            k -= a
            if k > h {
                k += h
            }
        } else if k <= c {
            out = append(out, 'c')
            k -= b
        } else {
            return ""
        }
    }

    return string(out)
}
```

## Performance

Now we have fastest performance

```
Runtime: 0 ms, faster than 100.00% of Go online submissions for The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n.
Memory Usage: 2.1 MB, less than 100.00% of Go online submissions for The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n.
```
